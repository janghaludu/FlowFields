Flow Field-Based Image Displacement Mapping Through Adaptive Triangulation


Gemini and I present a novel approach for creating pseudo-depth displacement effects in digital images through the combination of Perlin noise-based flow fields and adaptive Delaunay triangulation. Our method employs brightness-weighted sampling to generate a non-uniform point distribution that captures image features, followed by triangulation-based mesh generation. Each triangle undergoes vertex displacement guided by a continuous flow field, with displacement magnitude modulated by local brightness values. Additionally, we introduce dynamic color transformations in HSB space, including noise-driven hue shifting and displacement-proportional saturation fading, to enhance the visual depth perception. The algorithm achieves real-time performance through efficient triangulation and parallel vertex processing, making it suitable for interactive artistic applications and generative design workflows.
